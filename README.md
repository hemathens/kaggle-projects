# 🧠 Kaggle Projects by Hem Ajit Patel

This repository contains my Kaggle notebooks for various machine learning problems. Each notebook includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
All projects were completed in Python using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and more.
